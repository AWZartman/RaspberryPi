Vision 999 uses an attached camera to take a picture of a number 1-999.  The picture is then send up to Google vision for processing (an account is needed to get a token to be passsed into the program)

If the number is recognized, the LED's blink to match the number starting with the "hundreds" led, then the "tens" and then the ones" position.
